# Privacy policy

TTV LOL PRO proxies Twitch requests via standard HTTP proxies. As a result of the secure HTTPS connection between you and Twitch, the traffic cannot be read or intercepted by proxies during transmission. However, please note that the domain name of the Twitch website being accessed may be visible to the proxies involved in the process.

TTV LOL PRO includes default proxies to proxy Twitch requests through several ad-free countries. We want to ensure transparency by informing you that these default proxies may keep a log of IP addresses for a limited period, typically for the last 24 hours. This logging practice is in place to prevent abuse and maintain the integrity of the proxy service. It's important to note that the default proxies do not share this logged data with any third parties, further prioritizing the privacy and security of our users.

While we strive to provide a secure and reliable add-on, we cannot control or monitor the actions of user-provided HTTP proxies. Each proxy may have its own policies and practices regarding data collection, storage, and usage. Therefore, we recommend reviewing the privacy policies or terms of service of these proxies to understand how they handle your information.

By default, the Firefox extension logs any ads that manage to bypass the ad-blocker. This log is stored locally and can be cleared or disabled in the Firefox extension options. You have control over the log and can choose to send it to us for analysis or keep it private. We do not collect personally identifiable information through the log. Additionally, it's important to note that log entries are automatically cleared after 7 days to ensure data freshness and minimize storage.
